DDoS Attack Detection

Datacenter managers are facing serious security problems, either in detecting or preventing networks attacks. The need to detect anomalous traffic and network intrusion, became crucial to be able to protect data and computer systems. The Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS) remain the major problem that a datacenter network manager must cope. Existing intrusion detection rule-based systems are vulnerable when defending against adaptive attacks. Network anomaly
detection software based on statistical methods, i.e., Principal Component Analysis, presents a powerful method for detecting
a variety of network attacks and essentially DDoS. Real time anomalies detection is crucial to defend hosted applications at the right time and effectively, otherwise it can be too late.

This Notebook presents an implementation of the PCA method for DDoS attak detection.
